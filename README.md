PrixCompose is my tool for creating music for Super Mario Kart. As of right now it is a very low-level system, allowing you to use a text-based system for music creation. I do not have a GUI set up as of yet, however I do plan on making the system a lot easier to use in the future. I have provided a sample song called `victory`, which you are free to use, with credit. You may use this song file as a template as well to get an example of how to use this tool. You can find it in the `songs` folder as `victory.ssf`.





This program is provided completely free of charge, at no cost to the user. However, if you would like to donate in order to support me in my efforts in making more -- as well as better -- tools for the community as a whole, you can become a patron via the link below. 10% of all proceeds earned through that donation link will go towards the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a charity devoted to the betterment of autistic and disabled people.
